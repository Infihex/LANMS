## What is LANMS?
LAN-party Management System in the cloud. Available in the future.

## History

I, [Daniel](https://github.com/DanielRTRD), built a similar LANMS private project like this one which started back in 2014/2015. And now I want to create another one that is open-source and available for everyone out there.
