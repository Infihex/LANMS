### What is LANMS?
LAN-party Management System (LANMS) is a web-based application that you can self-host or use our cloud-based solution to manage your LAN-party events. It is designed to help you manage your LAN-party events, including tournaments, games, tickets, guests, and participants.

## History

I, [Daniel](https://github.com/dsbilling), built a similar LANMS private project like this one which started back in 2014. And now I want to create another one that is open-source and available for everyone out there.
