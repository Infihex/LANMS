### What is LANMS?
LAN-party Management System (LANMS) is a web-based application that you can self-host or use our cloud-based solution to manage your LAN-party events. It is designed to help you manage your LAN-party events, including tournaments, games, tickets, guests, and participants.

## Current Project Status
LANMS is currently in development and is **not ready for production use**. We are working hard to get it ready for the first public release.

We started the development of the new LANMS 3.0 in February 2023 originally, but other priorities and issues out of our control occurred so we picked it back up in February 2024. But now, as of 25th of September 2024, we are restarting the development from scratch to make it more user-friendly, scalable, flexible and open-source.

## History

I, [dsbilling](https://dsbilling.no), have built LANMS since 2014 when a friend and then coworker needed a system to control his LAN-party. It was initially started by [chilloman](https://github.com/chilloman) but a month into the development I joined. Since then, I have been developing and maintaining LANMS as a closed-source project.

In September 2024, I decided to make [LANMS 2.0](https://github.com/kilobyteno/lanms-legacy) (now known as LANMS Legacy) open-source and available to the public after having it on the back burner since 2020 (COVID-19). I have decided not to maintain [LANMS Legacy](https://github.com/kilobyteno/lanms-legacy) and instead focus on the new version of LANMS 3.0 (this repo).

_"Where is LANMS 1.0?"_ you might ask. LANMS 1.0 was the first version of the system which was heavily hardcoded for the first LAN-party event, because of this it will stay as closed-source until further notice. The first commit for LANMS 1.0 was 2nd of November 2014. LANMS 2.0 was a complete rewrite of LANMS 1.0 to make it more flexible and scalable, the first commit was 27th of February 2015, right after the first event.

 So now back to the present, LANMS 3.0 is the new version of LANMS, which is a complete rewrite of LANMS 2.0. It is built with modern technologies and is designed to be more flexible, scalable, and user-friendly.
