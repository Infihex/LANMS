## LANMS 3.0.0-alpha.0 - A New Beginning - 2024-09-26

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming release of **LAN-party Management System (LANMS) 3.0**, a modern, web-based application designed to help you effortlessly manage your LAN-party events. Whether it's tournaments, games, tickets, or participants, LANMS is crafted to make event organization a breeze.

### What is LANMS?

LANMS is your go-to solution for managing LAN-party events, designed to handle everything from game setup to participant management.

LANMS will offer both **self-hosted** and **cloud-based** options, giving you the flexibility to manage your events the way you prefer.

### Current Project Status

LANMS 3.0 is currently **under active development** and not yet ready for production use. Originally started in February 2023, the project encountered delays due to unforeseen circumstances. However, as of **September 25th, 2024**, we have officially restarted development from scratch, focusing on making LANMS 3.0 more **user-friendly, scalable, flexible,** and **open-source**.

Our goal is to deliver an advanced, community-driven platform that sets a new standard in LAN-party management.

### A Brief History

LANMS has a rich history, with its origins dating back to **2014**, when [dsbilling](https://dsbilling.no) joined forces with [chilloman](https://github.com/chilloman) to build a system for a LAN-party event. The original version, **LANMS 1.0**, was heavily hardcoded for a specific event and remains closed-source for now.

In **February 2015**, the project evolved into **LANMS 2.0**, a more flexible and scalable version, which was maintained privately until now and will become **open-source** in late September 2024 as **LANMS Legacy**.

LANMS 3.0, a complete rewrite of the previous version, marks a significant leap forward. Built with modern technologies and a strong focus on flexibility and user experience, it promises to be a powerful tool for LAN-party organizers across the globe.

### Whatâ€™s Next?

We are dedicated to delivering a robust platform, and we invite the community to follow our progress as we work toward the first public release of LANMS 3.0. Stay tuned for updates and opportunities to contribute!
