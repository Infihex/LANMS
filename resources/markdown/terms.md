# Terms & Conditions

By using the Service, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the Service. This Service is licensed under [GNU GPL v3.0](https://github.com/Infihex/LANMS/blob/main/LICENSE), and belongs to Infihex.

Infihex is committed to ensuring that the Service is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the Service or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the Service or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

LANMS stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your device and access to the Service secure.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Infihex will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the Service will require the Service to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, LAN, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Infihex cannot take responsibility for the Service not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to the internet, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

With respect to Infihex’s responsibility for your use of the Service, when you’re using the Service, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Infihex accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Service.

At some point, we may wish to update the Service. The Service is currently available on – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the Service to) may change, and some downtime is needed for updates for you to keep using the Service. Infihex does not promise that it will always update the Service so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. We may also wish to stop providing the Service, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Service, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
